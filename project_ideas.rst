Workflow Tree
-------------

A system of metadata annotation, through which the a data analysis process is broken into a series of discrete steps. Each step would correspond to an executed command, and have a defined scheme for input and output. Output of each step could be cached, so that changes in a step's output could trigger an update of subsequent steps.

A visual tool for input and representation would double as a sort of "visual analysis workflow", which would be extremely valuable for understanding another researcher's workflow.

There's a neuroimaging tool for this already: `NIPype <https://github.com/nipy/nipype/>`_
